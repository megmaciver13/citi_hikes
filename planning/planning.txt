CITI HIKES

CitiHikes is an application in which users can post hiking trips that they've taken from a major city (DC to start). The users will be residents of large cities who want to take a hiking day trip. They will be able to search hikes by how far away they are, how long a hike, difficulty, cost...etc. Users will also be able to comment on other hikes which are submitted.
